<!-- Core concepts

Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.
Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport
or device size.

Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint. 
Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally 
apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters.
We most commonly use min-width in our media queries.

Mobile first, responsive design is the goal. Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply
the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint,
and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices.
This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time,
and provides a great experience for your visitors. 

Available breakpoints

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, referred to as grid tiers,
for building responsively. 

These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.

Extra small	        None	<576px
Small	            sm	    ≥576px
Medium	            md	    ≥768px
Large	            lg	    ≥992px
Extra large	        xl	    ≥1200px
Extra extra large	xxl	    ≥1400px

Media queries 

    Since Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of media
queries to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These
breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale
up elements as the viewport changes.

Using media queries

Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type
(such as print vs. screen) or other characteristics such as screen resolution or 
browser viewport width. Media queries are used for the following:

    To conditionally apply styles with the CSS @media and @import at-rules.
    To target specific media for the <style>, <link>, <source>, and other HTML
         elements with the media= attribute.
    To test and monitor media states using the Window.matchMedia()
         and EventTarget.addEventListener() methods.

    A media query is composed of an optional media type and any number of media feature
expressions, which may optionally be combined in various ways using logical operators.
Media queries are case-insensitive.

Media types define the broad category of device for which the media query applies:
all, print, screen. The type is optional (assumed to be all) except when using the
not or only logical operators.

<input id="test" type="checkbox" /> <label for="test">Look at me!</label>

    Our grid supports six responsive breakpoints. Breakpoints are based on 
    min-width media queries, meaning they affect that breakpoint and all those above
    it (e.g., .col-sm-4 applies to sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl).
    This means you can control container and column sizing and behavior by each
    breakpoint.

    Containers center and horizontally pad your content.
    Use .container for a responsive pixel width, 
        .container-fluid for width: 100% across all viewports and devices, 
        or a responsive container (e.g., .container-md) for a combination of 
            fluid and pixel widths.
        
    Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding
     (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is
     then counteracted on the rows with negative margins to ensure the content
     in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. 
     
     Rows also support modifier classes to uniformly apply column sizing and gutter
      classes to change the spacing of your content.
    
    Columns are incredibly flexible. There are 12 template columns available per row,
    allowing you to create different combinations of elements that span any number
    of columns. 
     
    Column classes indicate the number of template columns to span
    e.g., col-4 spans four). Widths are set in percentages so you always have
    the same relative sizing.
    
    Gutters are also responsive and customizable. Gutter classes are available
    across all breakpoints, with all the same sizes as our margin and padding
    spacing. Change horizontal gutters with .gx-* classes, vertical gutters with
    .gy-*, or all gutters with .g-* classes. .g-0 is also available to remove gutters.

    Sass variables, maps, and mixins power the grid. If you don’t want to use the
     predefined grid classes in Bootstrap, you can use our grid’s source Sass to
     create your own with more semantic markup. We also include some CSS custom    
     properties to consume these Sass variables for even greater flexibility for you.
